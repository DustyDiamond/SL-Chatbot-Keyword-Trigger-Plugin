# SL Chatbot Keyword Trigger Plugin
 
A simple Plugin for Streamlabs Chatbot.  
It gets triggered by any message in twitch chat which contains any keyword in the given list.  
*Be careful it doesn't have a cooldown and reacts to everything that matches!*  
You can set your own command in Script Settings in Chatbot to list all keywords in twitch chat.  
You can set the bot response message as you whish. Keep in mind that `@{0}` refers to the user which triggered the script.
